# PEDOMETER-USING-ARDUINO

THIS CODE IS FREE TO USE AND CAN BE EDITED AS PER PREFERENCES.
ARDUINO CODE FOR A SIMPLE PEDOMETER THAT MEASURES NUMBER OF STEPS, CALORIES BURNT, DISTANCE WALKED, TEMPERATURE OF THE SURROUNDING AREA AND BATTERY PERCENTAGE.
THE STEP COUNTER IS FAIRLY GOOD WITH +-15 STEPS ERRORS.
THE BATTERY PERCENTAGE FEATURE IS NOT TESTED YET BUT WILL BE TESTED AND UPDATED IN NEXT UPDATES.
NOTE: THE CALORIE FORMULA AND DISTANCE COUNTER USE AVERAGE VALUES AND IS NOT OPTIMIZED FOR EVERYONE.
TO GET ACCURATE OUTPUTS YOU WILL HAVE TO OPTIMIZE IT YOURSELF.

The project can also be used to develop a full flegied working prototype but as of now it is on a development stage
